### Future expansion

I am aware that application could be expanden for example profile user could be more complex. This application was made only for training purpose and it contains basic funcionality that is required. Stay tuned!

### Attention

This application might not be fully responsive and I am trully sorry for that. I would not recommend using it on small devices. I would like to focus myself on learning new tools/frameworks and technologys. Fully mobile version of this apllication might be created later on using [Vue native](https://vue-native.io/). Thank you for your attention and sorry for every mistake :)
